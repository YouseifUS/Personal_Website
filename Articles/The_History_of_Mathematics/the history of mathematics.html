          <p>
            Mathematics perhaps was the thing you were afraid of when you were a
            child and you wish it hadn’t been invented but you never felt how
            much it is important, you can’t live one day without using it. Now
            we use it in different fields, such as machine learning, computer
            science, data science, etc. Have you thought previously about how it
            was created? How did it?

          <h2>How Did Mathematics Start?</h2>
          <p>
            The human usage of math started before the invention of writing, so
            we can't know for sure how it started because math is like a
            discovery, not an invention. However, there are a few theories. One
            theory suggests it was developed by needs, such as when two men
            collected a basket of berries and wanted to split it, they set the
            division. Even in antiquity, it was developed by the ancient
            Egyptians and then the ancient Greeks.

            <li>Pythagoras (c. 570–495 BCE)</li>
            <p>
              Pythagoras was an ancient Greek; he was a mathematician and
              philosopher, and he had a school called the "Pythagorean School of
              Thought." He is famous for his theory in trigonometry:
              (a<sup>2</sup>+ b<sup>2</sup> = c<sup>2</sup> ). It only works in
              a right triangle to calculate the length of the hypotenuse from
              the sum of the other two sides

            <li>Al-Khwarizmi (c. 780–850 CE)</li>
            <p>
              Al-Khwarizmi is a Persian Muslim scientist and is considered the
              founder of algebra. He is credited with the invention of the
              number zero and played a significant role in solving linear and
              quadratic equations. The term “algorithms” is derived from his
              name.

            <li>Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777–1855)</li>
            <p>
              Carl Friedrich Gauss was a German mathematician who made many
              contributions to mathematics, as well as astronomy and optics. He
              is renowned as the “prince of mathematicians.” His most important
              contributions are in both pure and applied mathematics.

            I think now you are starting to respect mathematics, and maybe you
            want to learn it again. I hope you enjoyed reading this; Wait me for
